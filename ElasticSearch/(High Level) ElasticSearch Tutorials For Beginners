- Horizontally Scalable Search Engine
- Each "shard" is an inverted index of documents
- Can handle text, structured data and can aggregated data quickly

Kibana
- Sits on top of ElasticSearch
- Web UI for searching and visualizing
- Complex aggregations, graphs, charts
- Often used in log analysis

LogStash / Beats
- Ways to feed daa into ElasticSearch
- FileBeat can monitor log files, parse them and import into ElasticSearch in near real time
- LogStash pushes data into ElasticSearch from many machines

X Pack
- Security
- Alerting
- Monitoring
- Reporting
- Machine Learning
- Graph Exploration


Logical Concepts behind ElasticSearch
- Documents : Every document has a unique ID and type
- Types : Type defines the schema and mapping shared by documents
- Indices : Index powers search into all documents

Analogy to Databases
- Index : Databases
- Type : Table
- Document: Row


Inverted Index
Document 1: Space: The final frontier. These are the voyages
Document 2: He's bad, he's number one. He's the space cowboy with the laser gun 

Inverted Index
<search-term> : list of document IDs containing the search term. Sometimes stores the position in the document

TF-IDF : Term Frequency * Inverse Document Frequency
Term Frequency : How often a term appears in a document
Document Frequency : How often a term appears in all documents
Relevance of a term is measured like this
