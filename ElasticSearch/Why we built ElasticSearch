BigData - Something that crashes Excel

A single tweet is composed of tons of information containing lot of metadeta like username, followers, hastags, location etc.

Can help in getting the analytics from the data

We want to be able to triagulate the data that we have:
(i) text (ii) meta-deta (iii) analytics

We want data to be refresh the data very fast! Elasticsearch is amazing for that

You do need to have enough hardware to support the data

There is a very simple rule when it comes to distributed systems: Collocation. 
Collocation ensures that we can achieve (i) freshness of data (ii) Ask and answer data in milliseconds

You should have a system that can do all the three tasks required for triangulation
