Recommend clothes through a combination of human stylists and algorithms

Biggest table adds 500-800M rows per day (over two years)
Data science jobs are mostly done in Python or R, and later deployed through Docker

As business grows, RedShift was brought in to help extract relevant data

Redshift: the good parts
-> Can be very fast
-> Familiar interface: SQL
-> Managed by AWS
-> Can scale up and down on demand
-> Cost effective

RedShift: Troubles
-> Congestion: Too many people running queries in the morning (~80 people in data team)
-> Production pipelines and exploratory queries share the same cluster
    -> Yet another cluster to isolate prod and dev?
        -> You need to sync the two clusters
        -> Will hit scalability problem again
-> There is no isolation between computation and storage
    -> Can't scale computation without paying for storage
    -> Can't scale storage without paying for unneeded CPUs

Data Infrastructure: storage
-> Single source of truthL S3, not RedShift
-> Compatible Interface: Hive metastore

Journey to Spark: SQL
-> Heave on SparkSQL with a mix of PySpark
-> Lower migration cost and gentle learning curve
-> Data storage layout is transparent to users
    -> Overcome eventual consistency problem
    -> Every write we create a new folder with timestamp as batch_id, to avoid consistency problem in S3
